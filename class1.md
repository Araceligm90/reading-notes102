# What is markdown?

Markdown is a plain and easy to use markup language used to write content on the web alternatively to HTML. 
It is used with plain text and adds formatting elements, such as headings, lists, URLs, images, etc. 

**Markdown basic writing and formatting syntax**

- Headings are created by adding '#' at the beginning of the sentence or word. You can add one '#' for the biggest heading and 6'#' for the smallest one. *Remember to leave a space between the '#' and the text or it **won't** work.*

- To **bold** text, use two asterisks at the beginning and at the end of a word or a sentence. You can also add an underscore before and after the sentence or word. You can also emphasize one word within a sentence using the same rule. *Even though asterisks and underscores are interchangeable when it comes to bolding a text, one asterisks will work to bold a single word in between a sentence.*

- To _italicize_ text, add an asterisk or an underscore at the beggining of the word or sentence and another one at the end. 

- To italicize and bold text, add either three asterisks or three underscores at the beggining and at the end of a word or phrase.

- To add a quote, add a '<' at the beginning of a sentence. They can also be nested by adding 2 '<'. For better readability add blan klines before and after the quote. 

- To create an ordered list, add a number followed by a period. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

- To create an unordered list, add dashes, asterisks or a plus sign. Indent one or more items to create a nested list. 

- To add an image, the easiest way is to drag and paste the image on your repository and then add it by using the following formula: ![Name you want to give to the image]+(Image.jpg). Note the exclamation sign at the beginning and erase the plus sign between the two sets of different brackets. Also leave no space between them. 

- To add a link use the exact same rule as for the image without the exclamation sign: [This is my cool site]+(www.araceliscoolsite.com). Once again no plus sign as well as no space between the two sets of brackets.
