# The Terminal

### What is the terminal? ###

The command line, most commonly known as *the terminal*, is a text based interface to your computerÂ´s system. You can enter commands by typing them and an answer or output will be given to you in a text form underneath the command. 

When you open your computer's terminal, you will be presented with a prompte. E.g. 

    Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$
    
Once you are there, you can enter a command. 

**Basic commands:**

1. pwd (print working directory): this command does just that. It tells you your current or present working directory or folder. E.g.

        /Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ pwd
    
2. ls (list): this command will tell you the directories at your current location. However it will only show visible files. E.g.

         Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ ls
   
         Applications	Documents	Movies		Public
 
 3. -l after the ls commands for a longer list of what has been shown. This will also give you additional information about the folders or directories. E.g.
 
        Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ ls -l
        total 0
         drwx------@   3 araceligarcia  staff    96 Nov 20  2020 Applications
        etc.
        Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ 
    
4. /etc is a command line argument that will tell ls not to list the current directory but to list the directories' content instead. 

         Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ ls /etc

5. cd (change directory) + name of directory or folder will open the selected one

        Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ cd applications

6. mkdir (make directory) will create a new folder.
7. 'pictures mkdir holidays': this will create a folder called 'holidays' inside my 'pictures' folder.
8. 'touch' is a command to create a file. It is very important though that you specify what kind of file you want to create. E.g.

        Aracelis-Air:~ araceligarcia$ touch lecture.doc

9. cd .. (change directories): this will take you back to the previous directoy. *You can go back as many times as you want typing an additional '.' for every directoy you want to go back to and adding an additional one.*
10. 'folder tree' will show you what is inside a folder.
