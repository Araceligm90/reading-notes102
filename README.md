# These are my reading notes!

### Here will go all my reading assignments and everything I learn in Code 102. 

Growth Mindset believes that skills and intelligence are something that people can develop over time with effort and perseverance. While there are people that have inherent qualities and traits, the ultimate success comes from personal development and it's avaiable to anyone who is willing to put an effort and achieve it. 

**Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:** 

- Failing only means that you have tried. ðŸ©¹
- The most successful people out there were at the sarting line at some point too. And made it! ðŸ’¡
- Big challenge, big reward! ðŸ’ª

The best example is that yesterday I didn't know what GitHub or Markdown were and today I'm doing this beautiful to be website! Keep moving forward.

# What is markdown?

Markdown is a plain and easy to use markup language used to write content on the web alternatively to HTML. 
It is used with plain text and adds formatting elements, such as headings, lists, URLs, images, etc. 

**Markdown basic writing and formatting syntax**

- Headings are created by adding '#' at the beggining of the sentence or word. You can add one '#' for the biggest heading and 6'#' for the smallest one. *Remember to leave a space between the '#' and the text or it**won't**work.*
- To**bold**text use two asterisks at the begginig and at the end of a word or a sentence. You can also add an underscore before and after the sentence or word. However, if you would like to highlight a word in between a sentence add the two asterisks to the work you would like to emphasize without any space between the word before or after it.
