# These are my reading notes!

### Here will go all my reading assignments and everything I learn in Code 102. 

Growth Mindset believes that skills and intelligence are something that people can develop over time with effort and perseverance. While there are people that have inherent qualities and traits, the ultimate success comes from personal development and it's avaiable to anyone who is willing to put an effort and achieve it. 

**Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:** 

- Failing only means that you have tried. ðŸ©¹
- The most successful people out there were at the sarting line at some point too. And made it! ðŸ’¡
- Big challenge, big reward! ðŸ’ª

The best example is that yesterday I didn't know what GitHub or Markdown were and today I'm doing this beautiful to be website! Keep moving forward.

# What is markdown?

Markdown is a plain and easy to use markup language used to write content on the web alternatively to HTML. 
It is used with plain text and adds formatting elements, such as headings, lists, URLs, images, etc. 

**Markdown basic writing and formatting syntax**

- Headings are created by adding '#' at the beggining of the sentence or word. You can add one '#' for the biggest heading and 6'#' for the smallest one. *Remember to leave a space between the '#' and the text or it **won't** work.*

- To **bold** text, use two asterisks at the begginig and at the end of a word or a sentence. You can also add an underscore before and after the sentence or word. You can also emphasize one word within a sentence using the same rule. *Even though asterisks and underscores are interchangeable when it comes to bolding a text, one asterisks will work to bold a single word in between a sentence.*

- To italicize text, add an asterisk or an underscore at the beggining of the word or sentence and another one at the end. 

- To italicize and bold text, add either three asterisks or three underscores at the beggining and at the end of a word or phrase.

- To add a quote, add a '<' at the beggining of a sentence. They can also be nested by adding 2 '<'. For better readibility add blanklines before and after the quote. 

- To create an ordered list, add a number followed by a period. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

- To create an unordered list, add dashes, asterisks or a plus sign. Indent one or more items to create a nested list. 

- To add an image, the easiest way is to drag and paste the image on your repository and then add it by using the following formula: ![Name you want to give to the iamge](Image.jpg). Note the exclamation sign at the beggining as well as that there is not space between the two different sets of brackets. 

- To add a link use the exact same rule as for the image without the exclamation sigg: [This is my cool site](www.araceliscoolsite.com). Once again no spaces between the two sets of brackets.
