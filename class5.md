## What is CSS? ##

css (Cascading Style Sheet) is the language that will make the content of your web page look good. 

HTML will allow you to write content, create different headings, paragraphs, lists, links and so on. However when you open a webpage written in HTML in a browser you are going to see that this is displayed in black text over a white background, which is a very basic style. 

CSS allows you to give that website a different a more appealing style and play with colors, text position, text size, text color, frames around text and iamges and so much more.

With CSS you can control exatly how HTML elements look in the beowser and create different designs.

## CSS Syntax

CSS is a rule-based language -you define the rules by specifying styles that will be applied to particular elements or groups of elements in your web page.

For example, in the example above we see the following:

1. The CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we want to style, which in this case is <h1>

2. The we have a set of curly brace { }

3. Inside of the braces but one line down we have the declarations, which will take the form of ## property ## and ## value ##. In this case, the property is 'color', then we have a colon and then we have the value, which is 'red'.

4. To finalize we add a semicolon at the end of the declaration and, if we are finished, we close with the closing curly brace.

As we can see, the example above contains more information, however the rule is exactly the same. 

CSS has a lot of values, some of them that can be easily learnt and some that will require for the user to look them up. That is totally normal!
