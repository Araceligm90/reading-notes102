# WIREFRAMING

## What is a wireframe? ##

Wireframing is commonly used by UX designers and it is used to plan how the information on your website, app or product is going to be displayed. This practice focuses on how the designer or client wants the future users of their product to see the information and interact with it, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

To make it simple, wreframing will allow you to test how the users will interact with your interface through the positioning of buttons, menus and images.

There are plenty of tools for wireframing, but the easiest one is just using pen and paper.
